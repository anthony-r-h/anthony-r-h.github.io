## Tote

Tote.dwg

- available leather in inventory is a thick
- so can't really do a structured bag, so there can't be too many painted edges on flexible parts
- therefore, top needs to be a turned edge and seam need to be turned => heavy skiving
- this constains base and gusset choices and location of side seams

choices:

- in the style of the lemon & lime bag but without the seam strap
- basic box bottom
- semi exterior gusset flap like the dpro or https://www.instagram.com/p/CeoNGj5BU3D/?img_index=1
