The `Name TBD` is a medium-sized duffle bag which is derived from the ACC-121 pattern from [Leathercraft pattern](https://www.leathercraftpattern.com/With-instruction-handbag-pattern-pdf-instant-download-ACC-121?search=acc-121&description=true). Similar to the original design, the side panels define the overall appearance and serve to provide a large degree of flexibiity in wear. My version differs by

- smaller size
- redesigned handles
- refinded interior
