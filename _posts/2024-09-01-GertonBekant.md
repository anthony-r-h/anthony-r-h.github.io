# About

In 2015, my dad and I assembled a desk using the IKEA Gerton birch tabletop and Lerberg legs. Over the past decade, through four moves and several major life changes, this desk has served me for tens of thousands of hours: school, work, play and everything in between. It was first upgraded in 2020 with under-mounted drawers, followed by cable management trays in 2022 for a USB hub and KVM. Now, it's getting new legs.

# IKEA Bekant

The IKEA Bekant frame is a powered sit-stand desk, introduced in 2014. It became popular due to its affordability compared to higher-end options. The original tabletop is a lightweight composite attached using friction-fit plastic hardware, but unsuitable for attaching a much heavier wood top.

# Assembly

## Preparation

Assembly instructions for the Bekant frame can be found <a href="/files/GertonBekant/bekant.pdf">here</a>.

To account for the lateral load from the monitors and accessories, I mounted the frame as far off-center as possible while ensuring the legs stayed within the footprint of the tabletop.

I used an abundance of masking tape to mark off guidelines and measurements.

Threaded inserts were used to attach the frame to the tabletop. Because of the large pre-drilled holes in the frame, I used flange-head M8 screws.

Driving these large threaded inserts into dense wood presents challenges, such as keeping the insert straight and ensuring proper threading without stripping the hole.

Here is the process I used:

1. Initial hole drilled to the nominal diameter of the threaded insert.
2. Reamed the top third of the hole by 1mm.
3. Countersank the hole to ensure the insert sits below the wood surface.

This method helps the threaded insert establish a few threads before fully biting into the wood. A drill guide helped maintain perpendicularity with the initial hole. I also used epoxy to glue in the threaded inserts.

Applying sufficient downward pressure while driving the insert also helps prevent stripping. A ratchet, T-handle driver or powered options are better choices for this than a screw driver. Although it would probably be best to do this manually, I opted for an installation driver.

## Finishing

Originally finished with polyurethane and although the finish was still in great condition, I took this opportunity to refinish the tabletop and to smooth out the original imperfections due to uneven wood joints.

Using an orbital sander, I smoothed the surface to 800 grit, starting from 50 grit.

Given the lack of a dust-free environment, I chose a wipe-on hard was oil finish over polyurethane. Application is super straightforward:

1. Apply with a putty knife.
2. Wait a few minutes.
3. Wipe off excess.
4. Repeat after a few hours.
5. Buff the surface.

# Installation

For this update, I had a few specific requirements.

## Drawer Solution

Due to the crossbar, my previous drawer canâ€™t be reinstalled. Drawers with _tall_ brackets are available to accommodate standing desk crossbars, and I used this space to store laptops.

## USB Hub and KVM Switch Mount

Since my laptop only has USB-C ports, I used a USB hub to connect to the KVM switch, which allows switching between desktop and laptop inputs. This created a mess of cables that I concealed under the desk.

## Desktop Mount

I mounted my desktop under the table using a bracket from AliExpress that accommodates small form factor cases.

Being a standing desk, its generally a good idea for there to be only one and only one cable running from the desk. This can get a bit challenging especially when there are a large number of peripherals in play. To solve this, I also mounted a power bar and server rack cable management duct to the bottom of the table.
