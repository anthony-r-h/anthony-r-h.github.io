## Notes

### Changes

- Changed construction method to X-stitched (pricked stitching holes for the outer and liner separately)
- Stitched from the middle outwards to the edges
- Orange peal effect wasn't as big of an issue as anticipated
	+ There were no issues with bending the headband to shape after stitching
	+ It makes sense to to define the folded edge after bending to shape
	+ Also, leave the last few stitches, especially the binding over stitch until after bending to shape to minimize strain on the binding stitch and to keep edges lined up
- This process produced superior stitching on the backside, however, added significant complexity to the construction
	+ It is necessary to count stitches
	+ As a result of X stitching, the effective stitch hole that needle and thread has to pass through is small. Combined with several layers of glue and leather, sewing is challenging and requires a round awl to stretch the hole before stitching. This would not be feasible with more delicate leathers.
	
### Issues

- It may not make sense to use the same backing pattern for the outer and liner side due to the fact that the difference in thickness means that they wont match perfectly
