The Believe Edge is a modular, no-hang hangboard built for focused, maximal finger training. It's designed for climbers who want a compact, portable tool that prioritizes specificity, quality, and intent. At its core: a solid, machined aluminum holder with modular, interchangeable edge inserts.

Unlike a traditional hangboard mounted on the wall, the Believe Edge is a lifting block. It's designed to be loaded with weight or used in isometric setups. As a no-hang hangboard, it isolates finger engagement without involving the rest of the body.

In the words of [Tyler Nelson at C4HP](https://www.camp4humanperformance.com/), _climbing training does not have to look like climbing._ By decoupling training from the act of climbing itself, this approach offers a simple, scalable way to develop finger strength directly and efficiently.

Following in the footsteps of the MetacarpEdge and the Lattice MXEdge, the unlevel-edge design applies the same core principle: maximize finger engagement. Rather than a flat surface, the stepped geometry promotes even load distribution across the DIP joints, encouraging more balanced and efficient recruitment. This more biomechanically advantageous position exposes the fingers to higher forces, making training more effective.

The Believe Edge is minimal by design.  There are no unnecessary features or redundant holds. However, when you do need a different edge, the modular format allows you to swap out the edge insert: one holder, many edge profiles.

The holder is CNC-machined from a solid block aluminum and sandblasted to a clean, matte finish. Not out of necessity, but intent. It looks good, feels good, and adds a sense of quality to the training experience. It is a deliberate choice: a tool that is as considered in foirm as it is in function.
