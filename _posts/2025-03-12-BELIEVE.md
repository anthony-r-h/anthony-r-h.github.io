The Believe Edge is a modular, no-hang hangboard built for focused, maximal finger training. It’s designed for climbers who want a compact, portable tool that prioritizes specificity, quality, and intent. At its core: one solid holder, interchangeable edge inserts.

Also known as a lifting block, this style of hangboard isn’t mounted to a wall. Instead, it is designed to be loaded with weight or used isometrically to isolate finger engagement without involving the rest of the body.

This approach separates climbing training from the act of climbing itself. You don’t need to hang to train fingers.  The result is a simple, scalable way to train finger strength directly and efficiently.

The unlevel-edge design draws from the same principles used in tools like the Lattice MXEdge and MetacarpEdge. Instead of a flat edge, the varying geometry encourages more effective finger recruitment by promoting even load distribution across the DIP joints. This creates a more mechanically advantageous position for producing force. This means more effective training, by maximizing finger invovement.

It’s minimal by design. No unnecessary features or redundant holds. But when you do need a different edge, the modular format allows you to swap out the edge insert. One holder, many edge profiles.

The holder is CNC-machined from a solid block of aluminum. Not out of necessity, but intent. It looks good, feels good, and adds a sense of quality to the training experience. It is a deliberate choice: a tool that is as considered in foirm as it is in function.
