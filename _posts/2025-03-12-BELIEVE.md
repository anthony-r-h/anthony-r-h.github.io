# About

Believe is a modular, no-hang hangboard built for focused, maximal finger training. It is designed for climbers who want a compact, portable tool that prioritizes specificity and intent. At its core: a solid, machined aluminum holder with interchangeable edge inserts.

Unlike traditional wall-mounted hangboards, the Believe Edge is a lifting block hangboard. It is designed to be loaded with weight or used in isometric setups in order to isolates finger engagement without involving the rest of the body.

Climbing training doesn't need to mimic climbing movement. By decoupling training from the act of climbing itself, you gain a simple, scalable way to build finger strength directly and efficiently. [Dr. Tyler Nelson at C4HP](https://www.camp4humanperformance.com/) has published empirical evidence supporting this approach, particularly the use of isometric protocols in climbing-specific strength development.

Rather than a flat surface, the stepped geometry encourages more balanced finger recruitment by adjusting joint angles across the hand. This positioning reduces dominance by stronger fingers and promotes more even loading through the flexor system. With a more biomechanically advantageous setup, the fingers are exposed to higher forces, making training more effective. The core principle is to maximize finger engagement - a concept also central to the MetacarpEdge and Lattice MXEdge.

The Believe Edge is minimal by design.  There are no unnecessary features or redundant holds. However, when you do need a different edge, the modular format allows you to swap out the edge insert: one holder, many edge profiles.

The body machined from a solid block aluminum and sandblasted to a clean, matte finish. Not out of necessity, but because it looks good, feels good, and adds a sense of quality to the training experience. It is a deliberate choice: a tool that is as considered in form as it is in function.
