# About

Believe is a modular, no-hang hangboard built for focused, maximal finger training. It is designed for climbers who want a compact, portable tool that prioritizes specificity and intent. At its core: a solid, machined aluminum holder with interchangeable edge inserts.

Unlike traditional wall-mounted hangboards, the Believe Edge is a lifting block style hangboard. It is designed to be loaded with weight or used in isometric setups in order to isolates finger engagement without involving the rest of the body.

Climbing training does not necessarily require the replication of climbing movements. Decoupling training from climbing, offers a direct scalable methods to target finger strength with greater efficiency. Empirical evidence, particularly from Dr. Tyler Nelson of [Camp4 Human Performance](https://www.camp4humanperformance.com/), supports the efficacy of this approach, highlighting the benefits of isometric training protocols in developing climbing-specific strength.

Rather than a flat surface, the stepped geometry encourages more balanced finger recruitment by adjusting joint angles across the hand. This positioning reduces dominance by stronger fingers and promotes more even loading through the flexor system. With a more biomechanically advantageous setup, the fingers are exposed to higher forces, making training more effective. The core principle is to maximize finger engagement - a concept also central to the MetacarpEdge and Lattice MXEdge.

The Believe Edge is minimal by design.  There are no unnecessary features or redundant holds (it only has one). However, when you do need a different edge, the modular format allows you to swap out the edge insert: one holder, many edge profiles.

The body machined from a solid block aluminum and sandblasted to a clean, matte finish. Not out of necessity, but because it looks good, feels good, and adds a sense of quality to the training experience. It is a deliberate choice: a tool that is as considered in form as it is in function.
