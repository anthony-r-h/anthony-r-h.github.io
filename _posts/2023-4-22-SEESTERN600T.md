## About

Introducing my latest watch project: the #SOXA 450T, inspired by the iconic Doxa 600T from the 1980s. This mod combines elements of the chunky and angular Doxa 600T with the dial of the 300T and the hands of the Ploprof. 

- Base watch: Seestern 600T
- Dial: Yobokies
- Hands: Yobokies
- Bracelet:  Strapcode

## Notes

- The bezel insert is not a standard SKX insert
- Ask Seestern if they will sell the ceramic black and orange bezel
