# Introduction 

- Hangboard training is widely accepted as the best method for improving finger strength, but recent research challenges conventional protocols (e.g., full crimp training, strict duration-based hangs).  
- This summary is primarily based on the work of [Dr. Tyler Nelson at C4HP](https://www.camp4humanperformance.com/).
- Training doesn’t have to mimic climbing or involve hanging to be effective.  
- Isometrics, including eccentric and concentric movements, are essential for finger training.  
- Effective finger strength training maximizes **finger involvement** without conflating it with coordination, endurance, or hold variety.  
  - Currently this ignores endurance, critical force, and anything else that is not strength or power.

## Fundamentals of Strength Training

- Off-the-wall training provides a more objective and reproducible way to build strength.  
- Non-climbing-specific movements allow for measurable, controlled, and structured volume, reducing injury risk.  
- **Training Goals:**  
  - Increase hypertrophy (muscle growth)  
  - Improve voluntary activation (neural drive)  
  - Enhance tissue stiffness (tendons, ligaments)  
  - Develop power (force production speed)  
- Strength before speed – power cannot be effectively developed without a solid strength base.  
- Strength training requires **progressive overload** to increase capacity.  
- Strength allows climbers to practice harder movements, leading to improvement through exposure.  

### Why Isometrics?

- Training with loads too heavy to move (isometric contractions) maximizes neural drive.  
  - Isometric contractions involve holding a muscle contraction without changing its length.
  - To recruit and sustain load, the body engages more nerve and muscle fiber groups, as opposed to dynamic movements where motor units cycle in and out of contraction.
  - This puts demand on the nervous system to modulate and maintain force output.
- Isometric contractions recruit a high percentage of muscle fibers and improve force control.  

#### Eccentric (Yielding)

- Involves pulling on a hold until muscles fail (similar to weighted hangs), engaging larger muscle groups (arms, shoulders, back) in addition to fingers.  
- Generates passive tension, heavily reliant on connective tissue strength.  
- Load on fingers exceeds what they can actively produce, causing them to "yield."  
- Produces greater force outputs than concentric movements.  

#### Concentric (Overcoming)

- Involves actively pulling against an immovable object (e.g., maximal effort finger curls).  
- Isolates finger flexors, targeting raw strength.  
- Force exerted matches what the fingers alone can produce.  

Both styles of movement patterns are necessary. Concentric pulls typically measure 50% to 70% of eccentric pulls. In practice, active finger strength is the difference between staying on a hold and being able to action  it.

## Coordination 

- Getting better at hangboarding doesn't equate to getting better at climbing.
  - Strength training includes a skill component (e.g., learning an exercise vs. getting stronger at it).
  - Early gains in unstable exercises (e.g., rings, calisthenics) often come from coordination rather than raw strength.
- However, the training objectives (stated above) do, therefore, to optimizing finger strength training means to maximize finger invovement.
- That implies
  - Elbow and shoulder positions should also maximize force production rather than replicate climbing form.
  - In general, it is suboptimal to train on small crimps.
  - **Unlevel-style edges** slightly stretch FDP and FDS tendons, optimizing force production.
  - Focussing on peak force, not stamina. Stamina is better trained through climbing-specific endurance work.

## Strength and Power

### On Strength

- **Hypertrophy (Muscle Growth):**  
  - More muscle mass = greater strength capacity.  
  - Not achieved through high-volume, low-intensity climbing - requires progressive overload.  

- **Voluntary Activation:**  
  - The nervous system plays a critical role in generating maximal force.  
  - Strength training improves **voluntary activation**, meaning the ability to fully engage muscle fibers on demand.  
  - More activation = greater force production without additional muscle mass.  
  - This is especially important for **maximal contact strength and force recruitment on holds**.  

- **Tissue Stiffness:**  
  - Changes in tissue quality (not just size) improve strength and resilience.  
  - Slow, heavy loading over time strengthens tendons and ligaments.  
  - Load type doesn’t matter - consistency and progressive overload do.  

- **Power:**  
  - Strength improvements enable power gains.  

#### Actionables

- Method of load doesn't matter much - choose the most effective tool.  
- **Edge size selection matters:**  
  - Too small = limits potential loading, better for coordination.  
  - Too large = doesn’t effectively target fingers.  
  - Best range: **25mm, 30mm, 35mm**.  
- Training parameters:  
  - High intensity  
  - Max effort with long rests  
  - Low volume (few reps, long recovery)  

### On Power

- https://www.climbing.com/skills/power-training-off-the-wall-part-i/
- Strength alone is not enough - **applying force quickly** is key to climbing performance.
- Power is critical for appling force quickly, decelerate efficiently, and move through space effectively.
- Power is the ability to generate force **fast**, which translates to improved **contact strength, explosive movement, and dynamic control** on the wall.
- Key elements of power in climbing
  - Rate of force developent (RFD): The speed at which force is applied. Faster RFD = quicker grip engagement and dynamic movement execution.  
  - Contact sterngth: The ability to rapidly grip a hold with maximum force, critical for deadpoints and dynamic movement.  
  - Reactive strength:  The ability to absorb force and redirect it efficiently. 
  - Tissue stiffness (tendon, pulley, joints): Tissue stifness improves force transmission and minimize energy loss, making explosive movements more effective.  

#### Actionables
- Lower intensity than strength training, typically x% of max effort load.
- Reduce fatigue to ensure quality of movement.
- Maintain **high intent for velocity** - each rep should be as explosive as possible.
- Dynamic Exercises for Power Training 
  - Fast **concentric contractions** (e.g., explosive finger curls or assisted plyometric hangs).  
  - Drop-catch drills (rapid release and re-grip on a hangboard).  
  - Campus board training (focused on short bursts, not endurance).  
  - Short, powerful deadpoints or max-effort limit bouldering.  
  - Weighted pull-ups with **intentional acceleration**.

Power training is the conversion of that strength into usable performance on the wall.
