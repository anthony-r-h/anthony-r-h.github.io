## About

I think #Peakdesign makes super-slick gear, but what if it could be *fancier*? Here is my take on their clutch camera hand strap made from #badalassicarlo waxy grey vegetable tan leather and using Peak Design's anchor mounts. Fancier? Absolutely, but a bit less practical: don't bring it out in the rain! ⁠

## Notes

This is super impractical for several reasons:

- Wire closure on G clip was added using the wire gate of another piece of hardware
- Doesn't serve intended function of being quick adjust
- Badly fits the hand: uncomfortable, and restricts movement

But it looks cool!
