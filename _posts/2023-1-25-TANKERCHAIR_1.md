## About

This is my newly refinished Goodform steel and aluminum propeller base office chair. It was manufactured in Youngstown, Ohio somewhere between 1930 and 1950. From what I can tell, this is an earlier model. Unfortunately, like for many of us, retirement is out of the picture for this chair.⁠
⁠
I originally picked up this chair in 2015 with cracked vinyl, rotting foam, and years of dust and grime. I did my best to restore it as a dummy, with the intent on doing better next time.⁠
⁠
This time, I think it turned out quite well! Handstitched in shrunken calf.⁠
⁠
A few notes for future me (when I reupholster this again), or whoever:⁠
⁠
- 3M Super 77 is incredible for foam⁠
- Use lots of binder clips⁠
- Batting is nice for blending edges⁠
- Also, here's the sewing pattern (print it in ARCH E) https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZy3IeVZnThFdvUOiuYyfMyQMh51qHvWkDs7⁠
