## About

> The 1960’s was a decade of unprecedented advances for Seiko, both in terms of technical development and design creativity. Alongside Grand Seiko, one other series demonstrated the company's ability to create beautifully designed and finished mechanical watches with high accuracy. It was called King Seiko. In addition to its precision, it offered a powerful yet graceful design that symbolized the high quality of its construction. Today, after more than half a century, the King Seiko collection is back with timepieces that showcase the lasting quality of Seiko’s mechanical watchmaking.
