The #M1W keyboard is pretty awesome. I've modified mine by replacing the original annodized gold accent pieces with black goatskin. ST 





Big thanks to @merqinc for their assistance with the 3D prints!

and I've made it even more unique by adding an Alran Sully goatskin accent. I've swapped out the original anodized gold component with custom 3D printed parts that I've covered in goatskin. Big thanks to @merqinc for their assistance with the 3D prints!

Here is something a bit different :)! This is my Chinese carbon bike build, sourced almost entirely from Aliexpress parts. It features the L-TWOO RX 12-speed groupset, Senicx crank and Elite gravel wheels. I get that this route isn't for everyone; Aliexpress can be a bit of a wild ride, but I find that exciting!
