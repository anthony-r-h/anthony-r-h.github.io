Leather accent replacements for the annodized gold trim in the #M1W keyboard. The new accent piece is 3D printed and wrapped in black Alran Sully goatskin. Big thanks to @merqinc for their assistance with the 3D prints!


The #M1W keyboard is pretty awesome. I've modified mine by replacing the original annodized gold accent pieces with black Alran Sully goatskin.
