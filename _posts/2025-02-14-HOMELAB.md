# General

## Project Goals
This home lab project is designed to be a practical, efficient, and educational** setup for learning, experimenting, and self-hosting services. The key goals include:

- **Networking Knowledge:** Understanding how networking components interact, including VLANs, firewalls, routing, and security.
- **Virtualization & Containers:** Setting up and managing virtual machines (VMs) and containerized workloads using platforms like Proxmox, Docker, or Portainer.
- **Low Cost & Maintenance:** Achieving a reliable setup with minimal energy consumption, noise, and upkeep.
- **Practical & Usable:** The final solution must be functional for daily use, not just an experimental project.
- **Self-Hosting for Independence:** Reducing reliance on cloud services by hosting key services like Home Assistant, backup solutions, and media streaming in-house.

## Why a Home Lab?

A home lab provides an isolated environment to experiment with enterprise-grade technologies at home. 



## Requirements

This project must balance several factors to be **functional, reliable, and maintainable**:

1. **Physical Constraints**  
   - Must fit within the DeskPi T0 which is a 4U, 10-inch mini rack.
   - Components should be efficiently arranged for airflow and accessibility.

2. **Power Efficiency**  
   - Preference for low-power devices such as devices which use embedded CPUs such as the Intel N100.
   - Passive cooling where possible to reduce noise and energy waste.

3. **Network Performance**  
   - 2.5GbE minimum with potential expansion to 10GbE.
   - Consideration of VLAN segmentation for improved security and traffic management.

4. **Aesthetics & Clean Design**  
   - A well-organized setup with minimal cable clutter
   - Efficient power delivery to avoid multiple bulky adapters.

5. **Scalability & Extensibility**  
   - Ability to add more storage, network interfaces, or compute power over time.
   - Modular approach to hardware selection.

Another factor is **cost**.


# Software & Services

##  Rationalizing Bare Metal vs Virtualized Deployments

While it is certainly possible to run everything in a virtualized environment, certain services are better suited for bare metal deployment.

- **Bare Metal:** Services that require low latency, direct hardware access, or high availability are best run on dedicated hardware. This includes networking components like routers, NAS systems, and DNS servers that must always be available.

- **Virtualized:** Services that benefit from scalability, snapshots, portability, and resource sharing are ideal for virtualization. These include applications like media servers, password managers, and smart home hubs that can be easily moved or backed up.

Another consideration is security and isolation. Services run on bare metal are not at risk of virtualization vulnerabilities. A compromised hypervisor could potentially expose VMs.

## Software & Services

### Options

Pi4 is overkill, but readily available with a strong ecosystem.

- 1GbE 
- ~4W-5W idle
- 2GB model is sufficient
- Will not run with PoE hat
- Case-as-a-heatsink - so LabStack module needs to be modified

## Router

### OpnSense and pfSense

- Requires x86 hardware
- Considering size and power efficiency, running this on desktop hardware is out of the question 
- These are essentially custom board solutions and besides having multiple ethernet ports, follows the same considerations as below (Hypervisor, NAS).
- Forerunner here is Protecli, but the devices are expensive.
- Aliexpress-tier brands like: Toptom, CWWK have products here, but with limitted support
- Yanling is the OEM for Protectli
- QOTOM seems to be in the middle of the pack

### Devices


- Minix Z100
  - Passive
  - N100
  - NVME and has a Wifi card which can swap for storage
  - 120x123x46mm - dimensions are challenging to work with

  - Cooling solution seems sketchy
- Radxa (Palmshell)
  - SLiM X4L
  - Unavailable

## NAS 

Low priority, nothing currently meets requrements, however, there are devices which getting there.

### Notes

TrueNAS requires x86 hardware and does not support ARM. For ARM devices, OMV seems to be the only option. While there are very compelling ARM options, for example (FriendlyElec CM3588), OMV seems lackluster and considerably less mature.

So we're going x86. First a few points

1. CPU

| Processor Model | TDP (Watts) | PCI Express Lanes |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Intel N100      | 6 W         | 9                 |
| Intel N125      | 6 W         | 9                 |
| Intel N355      | 15 W        | 9                 |
| Core i3-12100T  | 35 W        | 20                |
| Core i3-12300T  | 35 W        | 20                |

2. PCI-Express Lanes

- 10GbE takes 4 lanes
- 2.5GbE takes 1 lane
- SATA RAID controller 4 lanes
- PCIe x1 RAID card uses one lane, PCIe x4 RAID card uses four lanes
- NVMe drives, like 980 Pro use x4 lanes
    - A lot of boards use bifurcation, so NVMe drives each run x1
- N100 and related SoC boards which support 4x NVMe drives are limited by PCI-E lanes and run at 1x

On a typical N100-class board the lanes are deployed as follows

| Component                        | PCIe Lanes Used |
|----------------------------------|----------------|
| M.2 NVMe SSD                     | 4 lanes        |
| 2.5GbE Network Interface (NIC)    | 1 lane         |
| Mini PCIe Slot (WiFi, LTE, etc.)  | 1 lane         |
| SATA Controller (PCIe to SATA)    | 2 lanes        |
| USB Controller (High-speed USB)   | 1 lane         |
| **Total**                         | **9 lanes**    |

3. PCI Express Bandwidth

| PCIe Version | Lanes | Bandwidth (Gbps) | Bandwidth (GBps) |
|-------------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| PCIe 3.0   | x1   | 8 Gbps          | 1 GBps         |
| PCIe 3.0   | x4   | 32 Gbps         | 4 GBps         |
| PCIe 3.0   | x8   | 64 Gbps         | 8 GBps         |
| PCIe 3.0   | x16  | 128 Gbps        | 16 GBps        |
| PCIe 4.0   | x1   | 16 Gbps         | 2 GBps         |
| PCIe 4.0   | x4   | 64 Gbps         | 8 GBps         |
| PCIe 4.0   | x8   | 128 Gbps        | 16 GBps        |
| PCIe 4.0   | x16  | 256 Gbps        | 32 GBps        |

Also SATA III has about ~750 MB/s bandwidth.

4. Network Bandwidth

| Ethernet Standard | Bandwidth (Gbps) | Bandwidth (GBps) |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1GbE            | 1 Gbps           | 0.125 GBps      |
| 2.5GbE          | 2.5 Gbps         | 0.3125 GBps     |
| 10GbE           | 10 Gbps          | 1.25 GBps       |

So on a 2.5GbE NIC, M2 drives running PCIe 3.0 x1 will be limitted by the network interface.

Running interface bonding/aggregation with two 2.5GbE ports would double the bandwidth, but still be the bottleneck.

5. Creative Things

- M2 to occulink
- M2 to PCI Express
- M2 to SATA
  - JMB575 (port multiplier) doesn't support ASPM which prevents motherboard from going into lower power state
  - ASM1164, ASM1166 are better

#### A full mini-ITX device

Pros:

- Most flexibility
- No option to run embedded/mobile CPUs like the N100, so PCIe lane limitation is not an issue
- Access to a full sized PCI-Express slot
  - There are boards with integrated 2.5 Gbps NICs
  - So PCI-Express x16 slot can be used for M2 array, or SATA controller
- Standard power options: Flex ATX, pico

Cons:

- At a minimum, will occupy 2U of space due to the cooler
  - Integrated solutions (like mini-PCs or embedded boards) have proprietary, optimized cooling to reduce size
  - In addition, mounting for storage devices, power need to be solutioned
  - Currently, there is only one 10 inch rackmount mini-ITX case available. It is expensive, and not refined
- Constrained by slots and ports
  - If there isn't a 2.5GbE or 10GbE interface, a dedicated NIC will be required
  - Since there are unlikley more than one PCI-e slots, then it can't be used for anything else
  - Such as a quality SATA controller, even if the board has sufficient SATA ports
- By far, the most expensive option

There are few suitable board options currently.

#### 1-Litre _Business_ PC

- Dell Optiplex 5060, Lenovo M920, HP Prodesk 600 G4
    - Will need to find contacts on board or splice connectors to power drives, probably
    - Can use raid controller card like LSI

#### SoC NAS Motherboar

But can I trust these devices?

- Topton, CWWK _purple board_
  - Can be powered with Pico PSU
  - N100-class CPU
  - Need mounting solution for drives
- ODROID-H4 Plus
  - Same
- Radxa X4
  - Don't think they have a SATA hat
- CWWK Magic ?
- Radxa Rock 5C w/ Penta hat and custom heatsink
  - https://radxa.com/products/accessories/heatsink-6540b/

#### Mini PC

- CWWK x86-P6
  - PCIe 3.0 x1 (bifurcation)

#### Turnkey Solution

- Minisforum MS01
- Asustor Something
- TerraMaster F8

Interfaces 

- Loopback (`lo`), internal networking
- Main ethernet (`enp1s0`)
  - Master: `vmbr0`, so main ethernet interface is assigned to a bridge - Proxmox is using this to connect VMs
- Wifi Interface (`lo1`)
  - Not connected
- Proxmox Bridge (`vmbr0`)
  - Assigned IP is how we access Proxmox
- Virtual TAP Interface (`tap100i0`)
  - Interface used by a running VM
  - Is using `vmbr0` to get network access
  - Interface belongs to Proxmox VM with ID 100
- USB Ethernet (`enx00051b00a05a`)

Bring interfaces up

- `ip link set wlo1 up`
- `ip link set enx00051b00a05a up`

Install Wi-Fi management tools

```
apt install iw wpasupplicant -y
```

Scan wifi `iw dev wlo1 scan | grep SSID`

```

Next Step: Set Up OpenWRT as a VM

??? `qm create 101 --name OpenWRT --memory 512 --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0` create VM

Now, we’ll:

- Download and install OpenWRT on Proxmox.




## Download and Prepare OpenWRT Image**

This downloads and extracts OpenWRT’s bootable raw image.

```bash
cd /var/lib/vz/template/iso
wget https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/23.05.3/targets/x86/64/openwrt-23.05.3-x86-64-generic-ext4-combined.img.gz
gunzip openwrt-23.05.3-x86-64-generic-ext4-combined.img
```

Couldn't convert OpenWRT image to Proxmox Disk Format, not sure why. 

```bash
qemu-img convert -O qcow2 /var/lib/vz/template/iso/openwrt-23.05.3-x86-64-generic-ext4-combined.img /var/lib/vz/template/iso/openwrt.qcow2
```

So instead, we use the `raw` image in Proxmox `local` storage.

```
mkdir -p /var/lib/vz/images/101/
mv /var/lib/vz/template/iso/openwrt-23.05.3-x86-64-generic-ext4-combined.img /var/lib/vz/images/101/openwrt.raw
```

To enable image support for `local storage, edit stroage configuration

```bash
nano /etc/pve/storage.cfg
```

Modify

```bash
dir: local
    path /var/lib/vz
    content iso,backup,template
```

to 

```bash
dir: local
    path /var/lib/vz
    content iso,backup,template,images
```

Then we attach the `raw` disk to the VM as an IDE/SATA disk.

```bash
qm set 101 --ide0 local:101/openwrt.raw
qm set 101 --boot order=ide0
```

Next we set up the OpenWRT VM

```bash
qm create 101 --name OpenWRT --memory 1024 --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0

# Delete unused stuff
#qm set 101 --delete unused0
#qm set 101 --delete unused1
```

Pass through Wi-Fi (`wlo1`) and USB Ethernet (`enx00051b00a05a`) to the VM.

- Pass through Wi-Fi (`wlo1`) and USB Ethernet (`enx00051b00a05a`) to the VM.
  - USB Ethernet
    - `lsusb` -> `Bus 004 Device 003: ID 0b95:1790 ASIX Electronics Corp. AX88179 Gigabit Ethernet`
    - `qm set 101 -usb0 host=0b95:1790`
  - PCI passthrough for Wi-Fi
    - `lspci | grep -i network` -> `00:14.3 Network controller: Intel Corporation CNVi: Wi-Fi`
    - Enable IOMMU
      - `nano /etc/default/grub`
        - Find `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet"`
        - Replace `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet intel_iommu=on"`
      - `update-grub`
      - `reboot`
    - `qm set 101 -hostpci0 00:14.3`

## Connect to OpenWRT web interface

```bash
ip a s br-lan
```

says OpenWRT is running on `192.168.1.1`.

Make it run on my network

```bash
uci set network.lan.ipaddr='192.168.50.2'
uci commit network
/etc/init.d/network restart
```

Now we can access OpenWRT interface on '192.168.50.2'.

forget all that
 - 

 connect proxox to wifi
 bridge 

 so wifi b/c internet source, ethernet gets bridiged sending intent to switch

Forget trying to fix AX201 in OpenWRT. It's a client Wi-Fi chip, not meant for routers.
