A couple tips: - Use a food thermometer. Keep temp to 155 Fahrenheit MAX. I normally dye at 145-155 with no warping. - Use 6 bottles of dye per gallon of water

Make sure you add a (half of acetone) so it gets absorb the dye but make sure you add it before you start boiling the water if not it's going to make a splash
